Hi my name is Kevin Hirsig and I am currently a student at 42 Heilbronn.  
I am pursuing my coding career since the 14.06.2021.

---

* I am currently learning C, C++, [Unity](https://unity.com/de/solutions/game) and [CRYENGINE](https://www.cryengine.com/).
* In the future I want to work in the video game industry as this is my big passion.
* My current personal project is working on my own [chess game & engine](https://github.com/khirsig/chess42).
* For my studies I am recreating some of the [STL C++98](https://github.com/khirsig/ft_containers) (vector, map, stack, set).
* You can reach me at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-hirsig-149086213/) or via Mail.
